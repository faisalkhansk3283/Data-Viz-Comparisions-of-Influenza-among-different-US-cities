Summary:
There are 2 main folders in this Zip. Each contain the dataset(s), code, and Guide to the visualizations. Each main folder has it's separate folders for the code and datasets used. Note* the datasets are the raw data, any data processing is done in the code and not saved to a new excel sheet. Our process book is also present to give an idea on how our ideas and implementation changed.
